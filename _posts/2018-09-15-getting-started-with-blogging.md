> If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all: Read a lot and write a lot. - Stephen King

# I chose to write blog and usually read lot of blog and never felt to become a writer.

This is the first time I am using some static site generator like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for my blogging website.

Expecting my experience to be smooth and less painful.

Looking forward to share my experiences with you all.

However, expect a blog when I feel alone and lonely.
